# Avionics Anonymous Device User Guide

Avionics Anonymous is dedicated to providing high-quality electronics to the hobby robotics community. Many of our offerings were born out of needs we had on our own projects and found a surprising lack of good options on the market. We built these devices to meet our own needs and are excited to share with the world!

> **Tip** This guide contains everything you need to connect, configure, and use your Avionics Anonymous peripherals.
